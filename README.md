# tracker_test
Tracking bar path for analyzing snatch or clean and jerk is popular among novices and coaches alike. However, it has limited use and does not give us the full information we need to see what is wrong or right for an exercise; therefore, I don't recommend heavily relying on bar path. 
I experimented with opencv and tensorflow to see if machine learning is reliable for visualizing bar path, but from this test (and scripts written by others in github) I see that although ML can be faster than softwares like Kinovea or Tracker (from physlet), it is so far not reliable when there are distracting elements in the background. 
I'm not sure if it better to throw the latest technology on a simple analysis or use existing softwares that requires you to manually select area of interest.
I will revisit this project when I get more insight on computer vision.
